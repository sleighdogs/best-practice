#Git structure
This is a guide for using a particular git branching model when working on a
bigger development project where more developers are involved. This model was
introduced by *Vincent Driessen* in his [article](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)
where you can read about it more indepth with all the explanations and whatnots.
##Overview
The following picture illustartes the big picture of the whole branching model
used for big development projects. You can see different branches living side by
side more or less over the lifetime of the whole project.
